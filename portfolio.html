                    <p>This app was developed from my moving 5 times in the 
                        matter of 6 years and always trying to find the
                        closest frisbee golf course.  As an added bonus
                        it also gives the weather info for the area.

                    <p>I love cooking and baking, but always seem to need to 
                        continuously buy new ingredients or cook the same things.
                        This app uses the spoonacular API to search for recipes
                        using items kept in your pantry.  This app was built using 
                        Node, Mongo, and jQuery
